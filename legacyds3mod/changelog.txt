(name will likely get changed back, but it's really funny so it stays for now)
Curse-rotted Greatwood --> Treeballs
HP 4270 --> 3000

Abyss Watchers HP 830 --> 1400

removed them weird laserbeam spammers from dragonslayer armor

Yhorm Hp 10370 --> 2600 (hitting his legs does basically nothing...so I'm scared to buff him too much)
Ai Changes
Removed Yhorm's stupid roar move. Replaced it with slam. He slams more now.


Map Changes
_______________________________________________________

-quickstep dagger no longer required to complete certain areas (nerfed swamps)
stateInfo 287 --> 286 in deep water
stateInfo 286 --> removed in shallow water

made scripting changes in order to facilitate no-respawn enemies...however, these may have clobbered existing scripts
located in m31 and m35

added script in m33 to change mapceremony to 10 for 30, 34, 31, 33, 35
(in plain english, I added fancy eclipse to the map as soon as the player reaches road of sacrifices)

added script to default izalith2 crossbow ai to disabled

T-pose abyss watchers use darkwraith ai due to their default view range, this could possibly
be tweaked...but later. The T-posing is not that common, and it's kinda funny, so it stays for now.
(this can probly be fixed, I was able to fix creating new npc params by rebooting, so this may apply here too...)

Gargoyles in profaned capital can no longer block effectively. (This probably needs to be changed for the archives too)

added script in m31 to facilitate warp between undead settlement bridge, and farron keep bridge with stray demon
added script in m35 to facilitate warp between cathedral spider room and irithyll dungeon cell near bonfire

this was accomplished by adding a c1000 for the initial location, c0000 for the destination,
and adding a 4 digit ID actionbuttonparam

eID xx x x xxx
<map> <block> <type> <unique id>

Prompt EID: 6900
SETTLEMENT Warp EID: 3102769
FARRON Warp EID: 3302469
Script: 13105769

Prompt EID: 6901
CATH Warp EID: 3502069
DUNGEON Warp EID: 3902469
Script: 13505969

m30 = lothric
m31 = settlement <done>
m32 = archdragon
m33 = road/farron <done> may go back in for some lighting fixes...
m35 = cathedral <done> maybe turn on more of the votive candle things
m37 = irithyll <done>
m38 = not izalith + catacombs <done>
m39 = dungeon/capital <done>
m40 = firelink/untended <next> (buff gundyr lol) (more candles lol)
