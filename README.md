# Legacy Dark Souls 3 Mod
***This is all a work in progress and subject to change***

The goal of this project was to provide a more classic Dark Souls
experience for veteran souls players while keeping Dark Souls 3
as close to vanilla as possible. A lot of great mods out there tend to
alienate players who are just looking to make Dark Soul 3 a better experience.
They do this by adding too much and moving things around to the point where
a separate wiki is required. I love those mods, and after working on this project,
I have a deep respect for the folks that made them. But, this mod aims to keep it simple.
Hopefully, anyone who decides to try LegacyDS3 enjoys it as much as I do.

Stay human, or embered or whatever.

## Download Instructions

Copy and paste these files into your dark souls 3 game directory.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game

That is all.

To uninstall, either delete or rename (to anything) dinput8.dll.
Or remove all files I have provided from your game directory.

Currently there is a bug that will likely corrupt your save files. 
It's a good idea to backup your save files before using this mod.
These can be found in roaming appdata folder.
I don't know if this will be resolved, or if it already has been, because it doesn't happen to me.
Good luck with that.
